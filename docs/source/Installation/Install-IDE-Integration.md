# Install IDE Extension

We recommend installing the SpecFlow Visual Studio extension (IDE Integration), as this is the most convenient way of working with SpecFlow. An overview of the features provided by the integration can be found [here](../Tools/Visual-Studio-Integration.md).

**If you are using Deveroom, do not install the SpecFlow Visual Studio extension; you should only install one of these 2 extensions.**

_Note:_ Although installing the IDE integration makes it much easier to use SpecFlow, you can also use SpecFlow **without the IDE integration**. For more details refer to the [MsBuild Integration](Generate Tests from MsBuild) page. 

## Installing the IDE Integration for Visual Studio

The easiest way to install the IDE integration is to select **Tools ]( Extensions and Updates** from the menu and search for "SpecFlow" in the online gallery. 

The integration packages can also be downloaded and installed separately from the Visual Studio Gallery:  

* [VS2019 integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TechTalkSpecFlowTeam.SpecFlowForVisualStudio)
* [VS2017 integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TechTalkSpecFlowTeam.SpecFlowforVisualStudio2017)
* [VS2015 integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TechTalkSpecFlowTeam.SpecFlowforVisualStudio2015)

If you want even tighter integration with Visual Studio, [SpecFlow+ Runner](http://www.specflow.org/plus/runner) provides seamless integration with Visual Studio's Test Explorer and Team Foundation Server (TFS) and DevOps Build.
