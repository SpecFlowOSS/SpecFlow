.NET Core 2.0 and higher are supported from SpecFlow 3.0. .NET Core 3 is supported in SpecFlow 3.1.

SpecFlow supports the Microsoft .NET Platform with a .NET 4.5 runtime assembly (`TechTalk.SpecFlow.dll`). This assembly is also suitable for .NET 4.5.2 and .NET 4.6 applications.

If you need to test applications using .NET 3.5 or .NET 4.0, we recommend using SpecFlow v1.9.
