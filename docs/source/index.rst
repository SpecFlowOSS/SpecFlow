Welcome to SpecFlow's documentation!
====================================

Welcome to the SpecFlow documentation. Use the contents on the left to navigate to the topic of your choice. The documentation contains information about the features in SpecFlow. Information on the features in SpecFlow+ can be found in the SpecFlow+ documentation. If you are new to SpecFlow, we recommend that you start out by following our dedicated `Getting Started guide first <https://specflow.org/getting-started/>`_.

SpecFlow is an open source project, and this includes the documentation. Just like the source code, the documentation is also hosted on GitHub (as wiki pages). The wiki pages are mirrored on the SpecFlow website (refreshed hourly). If you find a mistake or would like to improve the content, you are encouraged to edit the wiki pages on GitHub. A direct link to the wiki page for editing is available at the bottom of each page for your convenience. Please use `Markdown <https://commonmark.org/>`_ formatting for the documentation pages.
