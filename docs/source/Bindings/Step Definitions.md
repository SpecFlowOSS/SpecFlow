# Step Definitions

The bindings ([[step definitions]], [[hooks]], etc.) provide the connection between your feature files and application interfaces (see [[Bindings]]). For better reusability, the step definitions can include parameters. This means that it is not necessary to define a new step definition for each step that just differs slightly. For example, the steps `When I perform a simple search on 'Domain'` and `When I perform a simple search on 'Communication'` can be automated with a single step definition, with 'Domain' and 'Communication' as parameters. 

The following example shows a simple step definition that matches to the step `When I perform a simple search on 'Domain'`:

```c#
[When(@"I perform a simple search on '(.*)'")]
public void WhenIPerformASimpleSearchOn(string searchTerm)
{
    var controller = new CatalogController();
    actionResult = controller.Search(searchTerm);
}
```

Here the method is annotated with the `[When]` attribute, and includes the regular expression used to match the step's text. This regular expression uses (`(.*)`) to define parameters for the method.

Although the step definitions are usually invoked by the SpecFlow runtime, you can also call steps from other step definitions. Check the [[Calling Steps from Step Definitions]] page for details.

## Supported Step Definition Attributes

* `[Given(regex)]` or `[Given]` - `TechTalk.SpecFlow.GivenAttribute`
* `[When(regex)]` or `[When]` - `TechTalk.SpecFlow.WhenAttribute`
* `[Then(regex)]` or `[Then]` - `TechTalk.SpecFlow.ThenAttribute`
* `[StepDefinition(regex)]` or `[StepDefinition]` - `TechTalk.SpecFlow.StepDefinitionAttribute`, matches for given, when or then attributes

You can annotate a single method with multiple attributes in order to support different phrasings in the feature file for the same automation logic.

```c#
[When(@"I perform a simple search on '(.*)'")]
[When(@"I search for '(.*)'")]
public void WhenIPerformASimpleSearchOn(string searchTerm)
{
  ...
}
```

## Rules for the Step Definition Method

* Must be in a public class, marked with the `[Binding]` attribute.
* Must be a public method.
* Can be either a static or an instance method. If it is an instance method, the containing class will be instantiated once for every scenario.
* Cannot have `out` or `ref` parameters.
* Cannot have a return type. 

## Step Matching Rules
* The rules depend on the step definition style you use. Check the [[step definition styles]] page for the exact rules.

## Parameter Matching Rules

* Step definitions can specify parameters. These will match to the parameters of the step definition method.
* The method parameter type can be `string` or other .NET type. In the later case [[configurable conversion|Step Argument Conversions]] is applied.
* With regular expressions
  * The match groups (`(â€¦)`) of the regular expression define the arguments for the method based on the order (the match result of the first group becomes the first argument, etc.).
  * You can use non-capturing groups `(?:regex)` in order to use groups without a method argument.
* With method name matching
  * You can refer to the method parameters with either the parameter name (ALL-CAPS) or the parameter index (zero-based) with the `P` prefix, e.g. `P0`.

## Table or Multi-line Text Arguments

If the step definition method should match for steps having [[table or multi-line text arguments|Using Gherkin Language in SpecFlow]], additional `Table` and/or `string` parameters have to be defined in the method signature to be able to receive these arguments. If both table and multi-line text argument are used for the step, the multi-line text argument is provided first.
