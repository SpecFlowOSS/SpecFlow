# Definition of Terms

## Runtime
Runtime is then, when scenarios are executed by a test runner

## GeneratorTime
GeneratorTime is then, when the code-behind files are generated. 

## Code-Behind files
For every feature file, SpecFlow generates a code-behind file, which contains the code for the various test frameworks.  
It's generated when the project gets compiled. This is done by the SpecFlow.Tools.MsBuild.Generation MSBuilt task.
