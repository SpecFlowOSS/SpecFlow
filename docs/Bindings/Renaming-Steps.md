# Renaming Steps

You can globally rename steps and update the associated bindings automatically. To do so:

1. Open the feature file containing the step.
1. Right-click on the step you want to rename and select Rename from the context menu.
1. Enter the new text for the step in the dialog and confirm with OK.
1. Your bindings and all feature files containing the step are updated.

**Note:** If the rename function is not affecting your feature files, you may need to restart Visual Studio to flush the cache.
