SpecFlow supports NUnit 3.11 or later.  

Please add the NuGet package [SpecFlow.NUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpecFlow.NUnit/) to your project to use xUnit in your project.  
You probably also need the NUnit3 TestAdapter NuGet Package [NUnit3TestAdapter](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit3TestAdapter/) in your project that the scenarios will be visible in the Visual Studio Test Explorer.
