# Executing specific Scenarios in your Build pipeline

SpecFlow converts the tags in your feature files to test case categories:

- SpecFlow+ Runner: TestCategory
- NUnit: Category or TestCategory
- MSTest: TestCategory
- xUnit: Trait (similar functionality, SpecFlow will insert a Trait attribute with `Category` name)

This category can be used to filter the test execution in your build pipeline. Note that the incorrect filter can lead to no test getting executed.

You don't have to include the `@` prefix in the filter expression.

Learn more about the filters in Microsoft's [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/selective-unit-tests?pivots=xunit).

## Examples

All the examples here are using `Category`, but if you are using `MsTest` or `SpecFlow+ Runner` then you should use `TestCategory` instead.

### How to use the filters

Below are 2 scenarios where one of them has a tag: `@done`, and the other one does not have a tag.

```gherkin
Feature: Breakfast

@done
Scenario: Eating cucumbers
  Given there are 12 cucumbers
  When I eat 5 cucumbers
  Then I should have 7 cucumbers

Scenario: Use all the sugar
  Given there is some sugar in the cup
  When I put all the sugar to my coffee
  Then the cup is empty
```

If we would like to run only the scenario with `@done` tag, then the filter should look like:

```bash
Category=done
```

---

Below are 2 scenarios where one of them has a tag: `@done`, and the other one has `@automated`.

```gherkin
Feature: Breakfast

@done
Scenario: Eating cucumbers
  Given there are 12 cucumbers
  When I eat 5 cucumbers
  Then I should have 7 cucumbers

@automated
Scenario: Use all the sugar
  Given there is some sugar in the cup
  When I put all the sugar to my coffee
  Then the cup is empty
```

If we would like to run scenarios which have either `@done` or `@automated`:

```bash
Category=done | Category=automated
```

---

Below are 2 scenarios where one of them has a tag: `@done`, and the other one has `@automated`. There is also a `@US123` tag at Feature level.

```gherkin
@US123
Feature: Breakfast

@done
Scenario: Eating cucumbers
  Given there are 12 cucumbers
  When I eat 5 cucumbers
  Then I should have 7 cucumbers

@automated
Scenario: Use all the sugar
  Given there is some sugar in the cup
  When I put all the sugar to my coffee
  Then the cup is empty
```

If we would like to run only those scenarios, which have both `@US123` and `@done`:

```bash
Category=US123 & Category=done
```

Below are 2 scenarios where one of them has two tags: `@done` and `@important`. There is another scenario, which has the `@automated` tag, and there is a `@us123` tag at Feature level.

```gherkin
@US123
Feature: Breakfast

@done @important
Scenario: Eating cucumbers
  Given there are 12 cucumbers
  When I eat 5 cucumbers
  Then I should have 7 cucumbers

@automated
Scenario: Use all the sugar
  Given there is some sugar in the cup
  When I put all the sugar to my coffee
  Then the cup is empty
```

If we would like to run only those scenarios, which have both `@done` and `@important`:

```bash
Category=done & Category=important
```

---

### dotnet test

Use the `--filter` command-line option:

```bash
dotnet test --filter Category=done
```

```bash
dotnet test --filter "Category=us123 & Category=done"
```

```bash
dotnet test --filter "Category=done | Category=automated"
```

### vstest.console.exe

Use the `/TestCaseFilter` command-line option:

```bash
vstest.console.exe "C:\Temp\BookShop.AcceptanceTests.dll" /TestCaseFilter:"Category=done"
```

```bash
vstest.console.exe "C:\Temp\BookShop.AcceptanceTests.dll" /TestCaseFilter:"Category=us123 & Category=done"
```

```bash
vstest.console.exe "C:\Temp\BookShop.AcceptanceTests.dll" /TestCaseFilter:"Category=done | Category=automated"
```

### Azure DevOps - Visual Studio Test task

*>**Note:** This task is supported only on Windows agents and cannot be used on other platforms.*

The filter expression should be provided in the "Test filter criteria" setting in the `Visual Studio Test` task:

![Visual Studio Test task](/_static/images/task_filter1.png)

![Visual Studio Test task](/_static/images/task_filter2.png)

### Azure DevOps - .NET Core task

Alternatively you could use the dotnet task (DotNetCoreCLI) to run your tests. This works on all kinds of build agents:

```bash
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  displayName: 'dotnet test'
  inputs:
    command: test
    projects: 'BookShop.AcceptanceTests'
    arguments: '--filter "Category=done"'
```

```bash
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  displayName: 'dotnet test'
  inputs:
    command: test
    projects: 'BookShop.AcceptanceTests'
    arguments: '--filter "Category=us123 & Category=done"'
```
