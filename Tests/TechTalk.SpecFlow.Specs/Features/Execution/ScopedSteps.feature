Feature: Scoping step definitions
	As a developer
	I would like to be able to scope the step definitions (bindings) on method and class level
	So that I can implement test logic differently depending on the usage context

Attribute usage:

[Scope(Tag = "mytag", Feature = "feature title", Scenario = "scenario title")] 

Future ideas:
* scope for previous steps ([StepContext(Step = "my previous step for doing something")])
* use regex in scopes ([StepContext(Scenario = "(my )?scenario title")])
