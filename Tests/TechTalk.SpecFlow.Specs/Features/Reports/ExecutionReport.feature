Feature: Generating HTML report from NUnit/MsTest execution result

Background: 
	Given there is a feature 'Feature with successful scenarios' with 2 passing 0 failing 0 pending and 0 ignored scenarios
	And there is a feature 'Feature with failing scenarios' with 0 passing 1 failing 1 pending and 1 ignored scenarios


Scenario: Summary is included in the HTML result (NUnit)
	Given there are NUnit test execution results for the project
	When I generate SpecFlow NUnit execution report
	Then the generated report contains
	"""
		Summary 
		Features	Success rate	Scenarios	Success		Failed	Pending		Ignored 
		2 features	40%				5			2			1		1			1
