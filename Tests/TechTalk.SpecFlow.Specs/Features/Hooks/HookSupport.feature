Feature: Execute hooks
    As a developer
    I would like to be able to hook into pre and post conditions in SpecFlow
    So that I can set up and teardown my scenario accordingly

Scenario Outline: Should execute SpecFlow events
    Given a scenario 'Simple Scenario' as
         """
         When I do something
         """
    And a hook 'HookFor<event>' for '<event>'
    And all steps are bound and pass
    When I execute the tests
    Then the hook 'HookFor<event>' is executed once

Examples: 
    | event               |
    | BeforeScenario      |
    | AfterScenario       |
    | BeforeFeature       |
    | AfterFeature        |
    | BeforeStep          |
    | AfterStep           |
    | BeforeScenarioBlock |
    | AfterScenarioBlock  |
    | BeforeTestRun       |
    | AfterTestRun        |

Examples: Cucumber compatibility
    | event  |
    | Before |
    | After  |

Scenario Outline: Hooks should be executed if they take longer (>100ms)
    Given a scenario 'Simple Scenario' as
         """
         When I do something
         """
    And a long running hook 'HookFor<event>' for '<event>'
    And all steps are bound and pass
    When I execute the tests
    Then the hook 'HookFor<event>' is executed once

Examples: 
    | event               |
    | BeforeScenario      |
    | AfterScenario       |
    | BeforeFeature       |
    | AfterFeature        |
    | BeforeStep          |
    | AfterStep           |
    | BeforeScenarioBlock |
    | AfterScenarioBlock  |
    | BeforeTestRun       |
    | AfterTestRun        |

Examples: Cucumber compatibility
    | event  |
    | Before |
    | After  |

Scenario Outline: Should execute the hooks according to their semantics
    Given there is a feature file in the project as
        """
        Feature: Feature 1
        
        Scenario: Scenario 1
        Given there is something
        Given there is something
        When I do something
        When I do something
        Then something should happen
        Then something should happen
        
        Scenario: Scenario 2
        Given there is something
        Given there is something
        When I do something
        When I do something
        Then something should happen
        Then something should happen
        """
    Given there is a feature file in the project as
        """
        Feature: Feature 2
        
        Scenario: Scenario 3
        Given there is something

        Then something should happen
        """
    And a hook 'HookFor<event>' for '<event>'
    And all steps are bound and pass
    When I execute the tests
    Then the hook 'HookFor<event>' is executed <count> times

Examples: 
    | event               | count |
    | BeforeStep          | 18    |
    | AfterStep           | 18    |
    | BeforeScenarioBlock | 9     |
    | AfterScenarioBlock  | 9     |
    | BeforeScenario      | 3     |
    | AfterScenario       | 3     |
    | BeforeFeature       | 2     |
    | AfterFeature        | 2     |
    | BeforeTestRun       | 1     |
    | AfterTestRun        | 1     |

Examples: Cucumber compatibility
    | event  | count |
    | Before | 3     |
    | After  | 3     |


Scenario Outline: For ignored Scenarios no Scenario Hooks are called
    Given there is a feature file in the project as
        """
        Feature: Feature 1
        
        @ignore
        Scenario: Scenario 1
            Given there is something
            When I do something
            Then something should happen
        
        """
    And a hook 'HookFor<event>' for '<event>'
    And all steps are bound and pass
    When I execute the tests
    Then the hook 'HookFor<event>' is executed <count> times

Examples: 
    | event               | count |
    | BeforeStep          | 0     |
    | AfterStep           | 0     |
