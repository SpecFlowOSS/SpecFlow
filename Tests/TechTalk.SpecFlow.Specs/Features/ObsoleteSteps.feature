Feature: Obsolete Steps
    In order to be able to migrate steps to newer versions
    I would like to be able to mark steps as obsolete and decide in what behavior will that result
    As a developer

Background: 
	Given the following binding class
        """
		[Binding]
		public class StepsWithObsoletion
		{
			[Given(@"Stuff is done")]
            [Obsolete]
			public void GivenStuffIsDone()
			{
				var x = 2+3;
			}
		}
        """	
	And a scenario 'Scenario With Obsolete Step' as
         """
		 Given Stuff is done        
         """

Scenario Outline: Obsolete step should cause different behaviors based on configuration
	Given obsoleteBehavior configuration value is set to <ObsoleteBehavior>
	When I execute the tests
	Then the execution summary should contain 
         | Total | Succeeded        | Failed        | Pending        | Ignored |
         | 1     | <SucceededCount> | <FailedCount> | <PendingCount> | 0       |

Examples: 
	| ObsoleteBehavior | SucceededCount | FailedCount | PendingCount |
	| None             | 1              | 0           | 0            |
	| Warn             | 1              | 0           | 0            |
	| Pending          | 0              | 0           | 1            |
	| Error            | 0              | 1           | 0            |


Scenario: Obsolete step should have default warning message
	Given obsoleteBehavior configuration value is set to Warn
	When I execute the tests
	Then the execution log should contain text 'warning: The step GivenStuffIsDone is obsolete because it is marked with ObsoleteAttribute but no custom message was provided.'


Scenario: Obsolete step should use Obsolete Attribute message if present
	Given the following binding class
        """
		[Binding]
		public class StepsWithReason
		{
			[Given(@"Some old stuff")]
            [Obsolete("This step is old.")]
			public void SomeOldStuff()
			{
				var x = 5+1;
			}
		}
        """	
	And a scenario 'Scenario With Obsolete Step with Message' as
         """
		 Given Some old stuff      
         """
	Given obsoleteBehavior configuration value is set to Warn
	When I execute the tests
	Then the execution log should contain text 'warning: The step SomeOldStuff is obsolete because This step is old.'
