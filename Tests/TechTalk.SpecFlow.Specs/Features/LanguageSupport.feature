Feature: LanguageSupport


Scenario Outline: single Scenario
    Given I have a '<Language>' test project
    And there is a feature file in the project as
        """
        Feature: Simple Feature
        Scenario: Simple Scenario
            When I do something
        """
    And all steps are bound and pass

    When I execute the tests

    Then the execution summary should contain
        | Total | Succeeded |
        | 1     | 1         |

Examples: 
    | Language |
    | C#       |
    | VB.Net   |
