+ Added Assist support for byte, float, long, ulong, sbyte, ushort, single. With nullables. (Issue 120)

1.7.0 - 2011-07-29

Breaking changes:
+ There are a few breaking changes in the generated test code. If you upgrade to SpecFlow 1.7, you should either
  re-generate the tests, or setup your project to use a version for generating the tests that is compatible with
  the runtime you use (see "Using SpecFlow generator from the project's lib folder" feature).

New features:
+ Using standard Gherkin parser (http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/gherkin) v2.3.6
+ Using SpecFlow generator from the project's lib folder instead of SpecFlow installed for IDE integration.
  The VS2010 integration can be installed independently from projects using a different version. The VS2010
  integration checks the generator in the following paths:
  1. generator path configured in app.config (<generator path="..\lib\SpecFlow"/>)
  2. generator assembly (TechTalk.SpecFlow.Generator.dll) referenced from the SpecFlow project
  3. generator in the same folder as the runtime (TechTalk.SpecFlow.dll)
  4. generator is near to the runtime ("tools" or "..\tools", relative to the runtime)
  5. generator obtained through NuGet ("..\..\tools", relative to the runtime)
  If SpecFlow cannot find the generator or it is older than v1.6.0, the installed SpecFlow generator is used.
  If you use any custom plugins (e.g. unit test generator), this has to be in the same folder as the generator
  currently.
+ Added ToProjection<T>, ToProjectionOfSet<T>, ToProjectionOfInstance<T> to allow for LINQ-based comparisons. (by Vagif Abilov)
+ Cleaned-up CreateInstance<T> and CreateSet<T> for greater code maintainability.
+ Cleaned-up CompareToInstance<T> and CompareToSet<T> for greater code maintainability, and slightly more accurate value comparisons (like decimals with trailing zeroes).
+ Removed the |Field|Value| requirement for CreateInstance<T> and CompareToInstance<T>. Any header names can be used, so long as the first column is the name of the property and the second column is the value.
+ Can use empty spaces and different casing in the tables used for comparison (i.e. can use |First name| instead of |FirstName| )
+ Tables used with CreateInstance<T> and CompareToInstance<T> can now be one-row tables with each field as a column (instead of requiring a vertical table with "Field/Value" headers)
+ A default function to create a default instance can be passed to CreateInstance<T> and CreateSet<T>.
+ Syntax coloring support for Visual Studio 2008. Uncheck this option in the installer if you are using cuke4vs. (by Avram Korets)
+ SharpDevelop 4 (#develop) integration. Enable SharpDevelop 4 integration in the installer and use the SharpDevelop AddIn Manager
  to install the integration (select addin file from SpecFlow installation folder). (by Charles Weld)
+ Support for testing Silverlight asynchronous code. (by Matt Ellis & Ryan Burnham)
  See https://github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow/wiki/Testing-Silverlight-Asynchronous-Code for details.
+ TableRow implements IDictionary<string, string>
+ Add table row from a (total or partially filled) dictionary
+ Raname table column (Table.RenameColumn(stirng, string))

Fixed issues:
+ Installer executes devenv /installtemplates even if VS2008 integration is not selected.
+ Duplicated logic between generator and runtime (generator depends on runtime now)
+ MsTest tests are not properly attached to the right feature (Issue 96)
+ Assist methods now work with classes with multiple properties of the same enum type.
+ Refactor IUnitTestGeneratorProvider interface to be more consistent (Issue 4)

1.6.1 - 2011-04-15

Fixed issues:
+ Windows Phone 7 runtime (TechTalk.SpecFlow.WindowsPhone7.dll) is not included in the NuGet package (Issue 61)
+ Warnings in the generated test classes (Issue 58)
+ Improved tracing for VS2010 integration

1.6.0 - 2011-04-04

Breaking changes:
+ The Silverlight runtime assembly has been renamed to TechTalk.SpecFlow.Silverlight3.dll.

New features:
+ Added a Set<T>(Func<T>) extension method. The Func<T> method will be invoked whenever ScenarioContext.Current.Get<T> is called.
+ Support for tagging (including @ignore) scenario outline examples.
  NUnit and MbUnit: to filter for categories generated for the examples in the unit test runner, you need to
  switch off row test generaiton (<generator allowRowTests="false" />)
+ Using standard Gherkin parser (http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/gherkin) v2.3.5
+ Support for converting table and multi-line text arguments with [StepArgumentTransformation] (by Chris Roff, roffster)
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/StepArgumentTransfomation

+ Added a FillInstance<T>(T) extension method off of Table. When passed an instance of T, it will fill the instance with values from the table (like CreateInstance<T>).
+ VS2010: Re-generate feature file when the configuration has changed or a new version of SpecFlow is installed
+ VS2010: Improved intellisense for steps
+ VS2010: Intellisense for keywords
+ VS2010: "go to binding"

+ Windows Phone 7 support, see https://github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow/wiki/Windows-Phone-7-Support (by Max Paulousky)
+ Silverlight runtime can be configured from query string (by Matt Ellis)
+ Generate test parameters from scenario outline parameters and example set name for MsTest (by Qingsong Yao)
+ Isolated test generator interface (can be used later for using the generator of the project instead of the generator of the IDE integration)
+ Official NuGet integration (by Daniel Sack)

Fixed issues:
+ Scenario with only "*" steps fails with "System.ArgumentException: Unable to convert block to binding type"
+ Binding is reported as invalid if there is a matching step definition with different scope
+ Support for datetime comparisons that ignore 12:00:00 AM (issue 52)
+ Fix NUnit execution report to properly select features when .features is solely comprised Scenario Outlines.
  (by Jon Archer)
+ Tags applied at the feature level are now applied as Silverlight TagAttributes on the class. (by Matt Ellis, citizenmatt)
+ Rethrowing exceptions caught during steps would lose the call stack on Silverlight. (by Matt Ellis, citizenmatt)
+ SpecFlow emits an erroneous suggestion for the step bindings in VB.NET (Issue 32)
+ Refactored VS2010 intagration to better maintanability
+ Refactored CreateSet<T> and CompareToSet<T> extension methods to use the same logic as CreateInstance<T> and CompareToInstance<T>.
+ Step Intellisense doesn't show in Feature Background (Issue 23)
+ Xunit Theory Attribute/InlineAttribute using incorrect namespace. (Issue 40, by Kerry Jones)

1.5.0 - 2010-12-17

Breaking changes:
+ Changing the default value (true) of the allowRowTests configuration setting is not incompatible with older
  runtimes.

New features:
+ Step Intellisense for Visual Studio 2010 - displays the list of bound steps when pressing space or ctrl+space
  after a step keyword
  (Thanks to Marcus Hammarberg for the contribution.)
+ Options for Visual Studio 2010 - you can enable/disable the integration features (syntax coloring, outlining,
  intellisense) in Visual Studio 2010, Tools / Options / SpecFlow / General
+ Faster installation for VS2010 - if you install SpecFlow only to VS2010, the installation is much faster
  as we now entirely using the new VSIX infrastructure for the integaration.
+ Support for row test generation (NUnit, MbUnit and xUnit). This new feature is enabled by default, but can
  be switched off from the configuration with <generator allowRowTests="false" />.
  (Thanks to John Gietzen (otac0n) for the contribution.)
+ Support for specifying property names with blanks and case insensitive for SpecFlow.Assist (by Steven Zhang, jdomzhang)

Fixed issues:
+ Scoped Steps does not recognize feature tags (Issue 12)
+ Support for double and nullable types in table-helpers of SpecFlow.Assist
+ Support for enum parsing in table-helpers of SpecFlow.Assist
+ Adding comparison helpers to SpecFlow.Assist (by darrencauthon)

+ Excution report should list features ordered by feature title

1.4.0 - 2010-10-07

Breaking changes:
+ The generator has been improved to provide source code language. Because of this, SpecFlow test generated
  with this version will be incompatible with older runtimes.

New features:
+ Scoped Step Definitions: you can scope step definitions (bindings) to tags, features and scenarios. Scope filter
  can be applied to a class or a method with the [StepScope] attribute.
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/ScopedSteps/ScopedSteps.feature and Tests/FeatureTests/ScopedSteps/ScopedStepsBindings.cs
  (Thanks to Jose Simas for the contribution.)
+ Adding binding-culture to App.config. If set, this culture is used during execution of steps.
+ VB-Step-Definition Skeleton Provider: For VB-projects, the suggested step skeletons are generated in VB.
+ Merging strongly typed context accessors from Darren Cauthon's SpecFlowAssist
+ Merging table/row extension methods from Darren Cauthon's SpecFlowAssist
  Add a using statement for the namespace TechTalk.SpecFlow.Assist to use the extension methods.
  See also Darren's youtube tutorial: http://bit.ly/aY4VOd
+ Diagnostic tracing: VS2010 integration can display trace messages to the Output window
  if tracing is enabled. Tracing can be enabled by setting the environment variable SPECFLOW_TRACE
  to either "all" or to the comma separated list of individual SpecFlow traing categories (currently
  only the category "EditorParser" is supported).

Fixed issues:
+ Better error reporting for wrong Gherkin files (multiple errors displayed, detect duplicate scenario names)
+ Visual Studio 2010 editor slows down after editing a feature file for a longer time (Issue 9)

1.3.5.2 - 2010-08-11
