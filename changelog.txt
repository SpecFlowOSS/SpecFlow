1.3.2 - 2010/06/29

New features:
+ Support for MsTest for .NET 4.0 categories. Configure the test provider name to 
  "MsTest.2010" in order to use the [TestCategory] attribute.
+ Silverlight support (beta), see http://wiki.github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow/silverlight-support  

Fixed issues:
+ Report generation fails if no custom XSLT is provided


1.3.1 - 2010/06/21

New features:
+ Using standard Gherkin parser (http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/gherkin) v2.0.1
+ Custom XSLT can be specified for generating reports. 
  See examples in Tests/ReportingTests/CustomXsltTemplate.feature
+ The test error can be accessed through ScenarioContext.Current.TestError 
  (e.g. in an AfterScenario event).
+ [StepTransformation] attribute has been renamed to [StepArgumentTransformation]
  because this name describe the intention better. Using the old attribute will 
  generate a warning.

1.3.0 - 2010/05/05

New features:
+ Using standard Gherkin parser (http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/gherkin) v1.0.24
+ Context injection in step definitions. Step definitions can get a context injected with 
  constructor injection. (Issue 30)
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/ContextInjection
+ Using steps in other assemblies. This enables writing steps in VB. (Issue 19)
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/ExternalSteps 
+ Steps can be invoked from other steps using step text. See examples in 
  Tests/FeatureTests/CallingStepsFromStepDefinitions
+ Custom step parameter converters can be defined as a binding. 
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/StepArgumentTransfomation
+ SpecFlow feature files can be added also to VB.NET projects
+ Support for xUnit
+ Single installer for Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 (Issue 6, 10, 11)
+ Place GeneratedCodeAttribute and 'Designer generated code' region on generated code to 
  avoid having this code parsed by code analysis. (Issue 33)
+ Configuration option to disable all output. (Issue 29)
  Use the following config to disable output:
  <trace listener="TechTalk.SpecFlow.Tracing.NullListener, TechTalk.SpecFlow" />

Fixed issues:
+ SpecFlow Reporting doesn't work with Firefox (Issue 31)
+ Binding methods are executed using the culture of the feature file.
+ Several parsing issues are solved now (Issue 1, 8, 9, 37)

Fixed issues:
+ Runtime: Remove direct dependency on nunit.framework.dll from the runtime (Issue 12)
+ Runtime: Binding methods with more than 4 parameters cannot be used (Issue 21)
