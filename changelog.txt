Next - ???

New features:
+ Using standard Gherkin parser (http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/gherkin) v2.3.6
+ Using SpecFlow generator from the project's lib folder instead of SpecFlow installed for IDE integration.
  The VS2010 integration can be installed independently from projects using a different version. The VS2010
  integration checks the generator in the following paths:
  1. generator path configured in app.config (<generator path="..\lib\SpecFlow"/>)
  2. generator assembly (TechTalk.SpecFlow.Generator.dll) referenced from the SpecFlow project
  3. generator in the same folder as the runtime (TechTalk.SpecFlow.dll)
  4. generator is near to the runtime ("tools" or "..\tools", relative to the runtime)
  5. generator obtained through NuGet ("..\..\tools", relative to the runtime)
  If SpecFlow cannot find the generator or it is older than v1.6.0, the installed SpecFlow generator is used.
  If you use any custom plugins (e.g. unit test generator), this has to be in the same folder as the generator 
  currently.
+ Added ToProjection<T>, ToProjectionOfSet<T>, ToProjectionOfInstance<T> to allow for LINQ-based comparisons. (Vagif Abilov)
+ Cleaned-up CreateInstance<T> and CreateSet<T> for greater code maintainability.
+ Cleaned-up CompareToInstance<T> and CompareToSet<T> for greater code maintainability, and slightly more accurate value comparisons (like decimals with trailing zeroes).
+ Removed the |Field|Value| requirement for CreateInstance<T> and CompareToInstance<T>. Any header names can be used, so long as the first column is the name of the property and the second column is the value.
+ Can use empty spaces and different casing in the tables used for comparison (i.e. can use |First name| instead of |FirstName| )
+ Tables used with CreateInstance<T> and CompareToInstance<T> can now be one-row tables with each field as a column (instead of requiring a vertical table with "Field/Value" headers)
+ A default function to create a default instance can be passed to CreateInstance<T> and CreateSet<T>. 
+ Syntax coloring support for Visual Studio 2008. Uncheck this option in the installer if you are using cuke4vs. (by Avram Korets)
+ SharpDevelop 4 (#develop) integration. Enable SharpDevelop 4 integration in the installer and use the SharpDevelop AddIn Manager 
  to install the integration (select addin file from SpecFlow installation folder). (by Charles Weld)

Fixed issues:
+ Installer executes devenv /installtemplates even if VS2008 integration is not selected.
 
1.6.1 - 2011/04/15

Fixed issues:
+ Windows Phone 7 runtime (TechTalk.SpecFlow.WindowsPhone7.dll) is not included in the NuGet package (Issue 61)
+ Warnings in the generated test classes (Issue 58)
+ Improved tracing for VS2010 integration

1.6.0 - 2011/04/04

Breaking changes:
+ The Silverlight runtime assembly has been renamed to TechTalk.SpecFlow.Silverlight3.dll.

New features:
+ Added a Set<T>(Func<T>) extension method. The Func<T> method will be invoked whenever ScenarioContext.Current.Get<T> is called.
+ Support for tagging (including @ignore) scenario outline examples. 
  NUnit and MbUnit: to filter for categories generated for the examples in the unit test runner, you need to 
  switch off row test generaiton (<generator allowRowTests="false" />)
+ Using standard Gherkin parser (http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/gherkin) v2.3.5
+ Support for converting table and multi-line text arguments with [StepArgumentTransformation] (by Chris Roff, roffster)
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/StepArgumentTransfomation
+ VS2010: Support for specifying color for the step text
+ Added a FillInstance<T>(T) extension method off of Table. When passed an instance of T, it will fill the instance with values from the table (like CreateInstance<T>).
+ VS2010: Re-generate feature file when the configuration has changed or a new version of SpecFlow is installed
+ VS2010: Improved intellisense for steps
+ VS2010: Intellisense for keywords
+ VS2010: "go to binding"
+ VS2010: Automatic table formatting when "|" is typed
+ VS2010: Tracing can be configured from tools / options. The environment variable SPECFLOW_TRACE is not used anymore.
+ Windows Phone 7 support, see https://github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow/wiki/Windows-Phone-7-Support (by Max Paulousky)
+ Silverlight runtime can be configured from query string (by Matt Ellis)
+ Generate test parameters from scenario outline parameters and example set name for MsTest (by Qingsong Yao)
+ Isolated test generator interface (can be used later for using the generator of the project instead of the generator of the IDE integration)
+ Official NuGet integration (by Daniel Sack)

Fixed issues:
+ Scenario with only "*" steps fails with "System.ArgumentException: Unable to convert block to binding type"
+ Binding is reported as invalid if there is a matching step definition with different scope
+ Support for datetime comparisons that ignore 12:00:00 AM (issue 52)
+ Fix NUnit execution report to properly select features when .features is solely comprised Scenario Outlines. 
  (by Jon Archer)
+ Tags applied at the feature level are now applied as Silverlight TagAttributes on the class. (by Matt Ellis, citizenmatt)
+ Rethrowing exceptions caught during steps would lose the call stack on Silverlight. (by Matt Ellis, citizenmatt)
+ SpecFlow emits an erroneous suggestion for the step bindings in VB.NET (Issue 32)
+ Refactored VS2010 intagration to better maintanability
+ Refactored CreateSet<T> and CompareToSet<T> extension methods to use the same logic as CreateInstance<T> and CompareToInstance<T>.
+ Step Intellisense doesn't show in Feature Background (Issue 23)
+ Xunit Theory Attribute/InlineAttribute using incorrect namespace. (Issue 40, by Kerry Jones)
+ Scenario Outline - Multiple Scenarios table header row VS formatting issue (Issue 16)
+ SpecFlow step definition report generator throws unhandled exception when a scenario starts with "And" (Issue 45) 
+ VS2010: SpecFlow writes out feature and code-behind files with inconsistent line endings (Issue 28)
+ Step definitions can be implemented in abstract base classes (but the abstract base class must not have the [Binding] attribute). SpecFlow no longer tries to instantiate the abstract base class. (Issue 47)

1.5.0 - 2010/12/17

Breaking changes:
+ Changing the default value (true) of the allowRowTests configuration setting is not incompatible with older 
  runtimes.

New features:
+ Step Intellisense for Visual Studio 2010 - displays the list of bound steps when pressing space or ctrl+space 
  after a step keyword
  (Thanks to Marcus Hammarberg for the contribution.)
+ Options for Visual Studio 2010 - you can enable/disable the integration features (syntax coloring, outlining, 
  intellisense) in Visual Studio 2010, Tools / Options / SpecFlow / General
+ Faster installation for VS2010 - if you install SpecFlow only to VS2010, the installation is much faster 
  as we now entirely using the new VSIX infrastructure for the integaration.
+ Support for row test generation (NUnit, MbUnit and xUnit). This new feature is enabled by default, but can 
  be switched off from the configuration with <generator allowRowTests="false" />.
  (Thanks to John Gietzen (otac0n) for the contribution.)
+ Support for specifying property names with blanks and case insensitive for SpecFlow.Assist (by Steven Zhang, jdomzhang)

Fixed issues:
+ Scoped Steps does not recognize feature tags (Issue 12)
+ Support for double and nullable types in table-helpers of SpecFlow.Assist
+ Support for enum parsing in table-helpers of SpecFlow.Assist
+ Adding comparison helpers to SpecFlow.Assist (by darrencauthon)
+ Support for char parsing in table-helpers of SpecFlow.Assist (Issue 19)
+ VS2010 might crash after pasting into a feature file
+ Excution report should list features ordered by feature title

1.4.0 - 2010/10/07

Breaking changes:
+ The generator has been improved to provide source code language. Because of this, SpecFlow test generated 
  with this version will be incompatible with older runtimes.

New features:
+ Scoped Step Definitions: you can scope step definitions (bindings) to tags, features and scenarios. Scope filter 
  can be applied to a class or a method with the [StepScope] attribute.
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/ScopedSteps/ScopedSteps.feature and Tests/FeatureTests/ScopedSteps/ScopedStepsBindings.cs
  (Thanks to Jose Simas for the contribution.)
+ Adding binding-culture to App.config. If set, this culture is used during execution of steps.
+ VB-Step-Definition Skeleton Provider: For VB-projects, the suggested step skeletons are generated in VB.
+ Merging strongly typed context accessors from Darren Cauthon's SpecFlowAssist
+ Merging table/row extension methods from Darren Cauthon's SpecFlowAssist 
  Add a using statement for the namespace TechTalk.SpecFlow.Assist to use the extension methods.
  See also Darren's youtube tutorial: http://bit.ly/aY4VOd
+ Diagnostic tracing: VS2010 integration can display trace messages to the Output window
  if tracing is enabled. Tracing can be enabled by setting the environment variable SPECFLOW_TRACE
  to either "all" or to the comma separated list of individual SpecFlow traing categories (currently
  only the category "EditorParser" is supported).

Fixed issues:
+ Better error reporting for wrong Gherkin files (multiple errors displayed, detect duplicate scenario names)
+ Visual Studio 2010 editor slows down after editing a feature file for a longer time (Issue 9)

1.3.5.2 - 2010/08/11

Fixed issues:
+ Sorry, we're ironing out our deploy strategy with the new Mono/MonoDevelop integration.  We didn't 
  change the version in the MonoDevelop Add-In XML file.

    [/xsltFile:value]       Xslt file to use, defaults to built-in stylesheet if not provided
+ Visual Studio 2010 editor support: 
    - syntax coloring with configurable colors ("Gherkin ...")
    - outlining for scenarios
  Uninstall the beta integration (TechTalk.SpecFlow.VsIntegration.GherkinFile.vsix) before installing 
  SpecFlow 1.3.3.

Fixed issues:
+ MbUnit execution fails for pending steps (Assert method not found: Inconclusive)

1.3.2 - 2010/06/29

New features:
+ Support for MsTest for .NET 4.0 categories. Configure the test provider name to 
  "MsTest.2010" in order to use the [TestCategory] attribute.

1.3.0 - 2010/05/05

New features:
+ Using standard Gherkin parser (http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/gherkin) v1.0.24
+ Context injection in step definitions. Step definitions can get a context injected with 
  constructor injection. (Issue 30)
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/ContextInjection
+ Using steps in other assemblies. This enables writing steps in VB. (Issue 19)
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/ExternalSteps 
+ Steps can be invoked from other steps using step text. See examples in 
  Tests/FeatureTests/CallingStepsFromStepDefinitions
+ Custom step parameter converters can be defined as a binding. 
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/StepArgumentTransfomation

+ Support for xUnit
+ Single installer for Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 (Issue 6, 10, 11)
+ Place GeneratedCodeAttribute and 'Designer generated code' region on generated code to 
  avoid having this code parsed by code analysis. (Issue 33)
+ Configuration option to disable all output. (Issue 29)
  Use the following config to disable output:
  <trace listener="TechTalk.SpecFlow.Tracing.NullListener, TechTalk.SpecFlow" />

Fixed issues:
